"""The gate's entrypoint. `FACTORY_VALIDATE_CMD` points here.

    python harness/ci.py            the whole gate
    python harness/ci.py --quick    the cheap subset an implementing node runs on itself

THIS FILE IS THE STEP LADDER, AND THE LADDER IS THE SAME IN EVERY FACTORY.

That is not an assumption. Two people built this harness independently, on different
products, never seeing each other's work, and both wrote this shape: an ordered
ladder, a positive marker per rung with a count, a namer that reports WHICH rung
stopped the run, and a `--quick` subset. Both separately invented a "zero tests
discovered is not a pass" guard. The structure is determined by the marker contract,
not by the app.

EVERY COMMAND IT RUNS LIVES IN `harness.config.json`, not here. Hardcoding
`python -m pytest` would make a scaffold claiming to be universal quietly
Python-only: a Go repo, a Node repo or a CLI with no HTTP surface would have to
rewrite the ladder to change two strings.

WHAT IS STILL NOT TEMPLATABLE IS EVERY ASSERTION. What "working" means for your
product is the one thing nobody can write in advance. It lives in two markdown
files an agent reads on every run -- `harness/END-TO-END.md` and, above the
independence line, `.factory/holdout/HOLDOUT.md`.

THE CONTRACT, in four parts:

  1. A POSITIVE marker for every rung that RAN. The gate greps these by name from
     REQUIRED_MARKERS; it never tests for the absence of "error".
  2. A COUNT wherever one exists. A skipped check and a passed check are
     indistinguishable without one.
  3. Exit NON-ZERO when the software is broken.
  4. Print to STDOUT. The runner appends this to the guard's output in one gate log.
