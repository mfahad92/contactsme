"""Run one agent-driven rung and check what it reports.

The journeys and the holdout scenarios are markdown, not Python. An agent reads
them, drives the running app, and writes a result file. This module builds that
prompt, runs the agent, and validates the result.

WHY MARKDOWN AND NOT A SCRIPT
-----------------------------
A scripted end-to-end runs the same two requests forever. It goes stale the week
after it is written, because the product moves and the script does not, and the
staleness is invisible: it still passes. Journeys in prose stay true to the
product because the agent re-reads them against whatever the app is today, and
they cover more than the one path somebody had time to code.

WHAT THAT COSTS, AND WHERE IT IS PAID BACK
------------------------------------------
A model reporting on its own work is the exact shape of defect this project keeps
finding: something announces success without checking anything. Three mechanisms
answer that, and none of them is "trust the agent":

  1. THE RESULT IS DATA, NOT A CLAIM. Every assertion carries the value actually
     observed. `_validate` rejects a result whose `observed` is empty, or is a
     restatement of `expected`, because that is a report from a run that did not
     look.
  2. THE COUNTS FEED THE RATCHET. `E2E_PASSED steps=N` is compared to a protected
     floor. An agent that quietly asserts less than last time fails the gate.
  3. THE MUTATION SET MEASURES THIS RUNG. Deliberate defects are planted and the
     gate must go red. That is the only evidence that any of these checks can
     fail, and it now covers the agent as well as the code.

FAIL CLOSED, ALWAYS. A missing result file, an unparseable one, a timeout, or an
agent that is not configured are all FAILURES. None of them is a skip. An empty
answer read as a negative answer is how a gate reports green having run nothing.
