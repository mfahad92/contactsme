"""Everything that must be true before a single token is spent.

Four things, in order of how expensive they are to discover late:

 1. THE SECRET PRE-FLIGHT. `git check-ignore` over every credential-shaped path. An
    empty result means the commit step publishes your key, and on a public repo that
    is publication, not a mistake you can take back. Rotating afterwards is the
    cleanup, not the fix. This REFUSES to start rather than warning, because a
    warning is read after the push.
 2. The issue is actually buildable: it exists, it is `accepted`, and it is not
    parked at needs-human by something that happened since the dispatch.
 3. The issue is rendered to ONE file, ONCE, before any node runs. Every node opens
    the same path, so every node judges the same text -- re-fetching per node lets a
    mid-run edit change what the judge thinks was asked for.
 4. The state moves to `in-progress`, which is what stops a second dispatcher
    picking up the same issue while this one works.

Emits the identifiers every later node keys off, so nothing downstream re-derives
them and drifts.
