"""Read what the plan node decided, and act on it in code.

Three files the plan node may write, and they mean three different things:

  plan.md       required. No plan, no build -- a node asked to implement from a
                plan that does not exist invents one, and an invented plan is the
                most expensive kind of guess this system can make.

  ESCALATE      the short stop list fired. Park the issue, tell a human, and CANCEL
                the run. Everything downstream would otherwise run against a plan
                that says "do not build this".

  ASSUMPTIONS   a PRODUCT value the plan chose rather than stopped for. This does
                NOT stop the run. It rides into the PR record and holds the MERGE,
                so the work is built, validated and waiting with the reasoning at
                the top -- and the human answers a concrete question about a running
                thing instead of an abstract one in the dark.

  FOLLOWUP      part of the issue the plan deliberately left. Recorded rather than
                lost: partially building an issue is right, silently dropping the
                rest is not.

THE FAILURE THIS REPLACES. When the plan node is told to stop for "any open
question", one unmade product decision blocks every issue downstream of it. Measured
on a real factory: four issues, four escalations, zero PRs, and the SAME question
asked four times -- because an open question in a PRD was read as "you may not
propose" when the author meant "I have not decided". The more honest the PRD, the
less the factory could do.
