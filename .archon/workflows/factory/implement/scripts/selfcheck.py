"""Run the full gate, here, for the BUILDER's benefit.

NOTHING DOWNSTREAM TRUSTS THIS. The validator re-runs everything in its own process,
against its own checkout, with its own context -- that independence is the whole
reason a merge without a human reading the diff is defensible at all.

So why run it? Because a lap that opens a PR it already knows is red spends a whole
validation cycle to learn what a subprocess could have said here in two minutes. It
is a courtesy to the queue, not a gate.

DELIBERATELY NON-FATAL. A red self-check still opens the PR: the validator's finding
is what the fix node works from, and a red the builder cannot fix is a red a human
should see stated by the independent judge rather than by the thing that wrote the
code. The one thing this does refuse is silence -- an empty log is reported as a
fault, because a check that produced no output at all did not run.
