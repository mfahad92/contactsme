"""Commit the implement node's work. Without this, the whole lap is theatre.

THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR. The implement node edits files in the worktree, nothing
records them, and the worktree is discarded when the run ends: every node reports OK,
the guard correctly sees two changed files and thirty lines, and the branch ends up
empty. Driving the lap by hand hides it completely, because a human commits without
being told to.

IT ASSERTS ON THE ARTIFACT, NOT THE EXIT CODE. A node that was denied a tool exits 0
having changed nothing; a node that hit its budget exits 0 having changed nothing; a
node that decided the work was already done exits 0 having changed nothing. "The run
succeeded" is true in all three cases and useless in all three. An empty diff is a
failed lap, and it says so with the denials attached, because a denial is the usual
cause and correlating them an hour later in a log is not a process.
