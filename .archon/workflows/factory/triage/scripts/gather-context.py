"""Everything the classifier is allowed to see, assembled once, by code.

The classify node has NO TOOLS. That is deliberate: a triage agent that can go
looking around the repository ends up justifying its disposition from something it
found rather than from the governance files, and the citation stops being checkable.
So the inputs are assembled here and handed over whole.

Writes to $ARTIFACTS_DIR and prints the same text, because a command file reads the
prompt and a human reads the artifact.
