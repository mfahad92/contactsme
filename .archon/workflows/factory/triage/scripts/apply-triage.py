"""Apply the triage decision. Code, not the model.

The classifier emits a disposition; this applies it through factory/state.py, which
refuses a transition the table does not allow. Everything a human will read goes out
through the one comment helper, which posts it in a single process and READS IT
BACK -- because `exit 0` from the tool that posted a verdict proves the API call
succeeded, not that it carried anything.

A TRIAGE THAT DECIDES `needs-human` MUST REACH A HUMAN. That is easy to miss,
because a correct escalation is not a failure: it takes the success path, and the
success path is the one with no alarm on it. Measured on a real factory: seven probe
issues, two correct needs-human decisions, ZERO notifications.
