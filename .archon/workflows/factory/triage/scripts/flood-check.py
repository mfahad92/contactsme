"""Flood protection. FACTORY_RULES 1.

Non-owner accounts are capped at N issues per UTC calendar day. Excess issues get
`factory:rate-limited` and wait; the next day's triage removes the label and
re-evaluates them, so the cap is a DELAY and not a wastebasket.

Runs BEFORE the classifier so a rate-limited issue never costs a model call. The
repository owner is exempt -- you should not be able to lock yourself out of your
own factory by filing four issues in a morning.

Emits {"rate_limited": bool, "reason": str}.
