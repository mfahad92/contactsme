"""Load the findings, check the cap, check out the branch.

THE FINDINGS ARE ASSERTED, NOT ASSUMED. The gate writes them to a shared path when it
records `request_changes`, keyed by target so two PRs in flight cannot read each
other's. If they are missing, this run REFUSES: a fix node with nothing to read
re-reads the diff and invents an objection, which is how you get a confident commit
that addresses nothing and burns one of two attempts. Missing findings mean the gate
never recorded them, which is a machinery fault and belongs in front of a human.

THE PATH MATTERS. The findings live under the MAIN checkout, not this worktree --
they were written by a different run, in a different worktree, that has since been
deleted. That is exactly the state that dies if you resolve it relative to wherever
the current process happens to be standing.
