"""Commit the fix, push it, count the attempt, hand it back.

THE ORDER IS THE WHOLE FILE, and it is the order that survives each step failing:

 1. Assert the tree changed. An empty diff does not address a finding, and a fix node
    that was denied a tool exits 0 having changed nothing.
 2. Commit and push. Until this succeeds the validator has nothing new to look at.
 3. BUMP THE ATTEMPT COUNTER. If this is skipped, the cap is never reached and the PR
    ping-pongs until the budget is gone.
 4. ONE transition, to `open`.

Step 4 used to be two -- `validating` then `open` -- and the second was illegal.
Transition tables refuse illegal moves, the workflow died on that line, and no
escalation ran: no needs-human, no notification, nothing in the log but one line. The
PR stayed in `validating`, which the dispatcher does not look at, so it answered
`idle` from then on. A factory wedged that way is indistinguishable from a factory
with nothing to do.

`open` is the right target on its own: a fixed PR is a PR waiting to be validated.
The dispatcher picks it up and the validator sets `validating` itself, after the
tripwire, exactly as it does the first time round.
