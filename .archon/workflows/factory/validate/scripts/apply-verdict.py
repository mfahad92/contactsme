"""Hand the raw log and the verdict to factory/gate.py, which decides.

Nothing is decided here. This is the seam between "a model produced a judgement" and
"code acted on it", and keeping it thin is the point: the gate re-reads the markers
itself, overrides the verdict when they disagree, holds the merge on an assumption or
on ratchet slack, saves the findings where a later fix run can read them, and calls
the merge.

THE ONE THING THIS FILE OWNS is the case where the judge produced nothing at all. A
missing verdict is not an approval and it is not a rejection of the work -- it is a
validator that failed, and treating it as a verdict about the PR sends whoever reads
it looking for a defect that is not there.
