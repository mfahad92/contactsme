"""Compose everything the judge may see into ONE document, and hand it over.

THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO FIX, and it is the most instructive one in this build.

The judge runs with `allowed_tools: []`. That is the mechanism: the inability to go
looking is what makes its verdict about the diff rather than about whatever it found
on the way past. The prompt then told it to "read these from $ARTIFACTS_DIR" -- files
it had no tool to open.

It did exactly the right thing. It refused to fabricate a judgment, said its inputs
were missing, and returned reject. Which is correct behaviour and a rejected pull
request, because the prompt asked a node to do something the node could not do.

That is the failure the skill warns about in the other direction -- a plan that
specifies a step the next node cannot perform -- and it is silent in both: nothing
crashes, a node just quietly cannot do its job and says something plausible instead.

So the inputs are SUBSTITUTED into the prompt rather than read from disk. The judge
keeps no tools, and everything it may consider is in front of it.

WHAT GOES IN, and the omissions are the point:

    the issue, as filed                the contract
    the diff, against the merge base   what the code does now
    the commit SUBJECTS                titles only -- a commit body is the coder's story
    the gate log                       what the checks printed, verbatim
    governance from the BASE branch    the rulebook this PR cannot have weakened

    NOT the plan. NOT the implementation report. NOT the priming. NOT any comment on
    the PR, including the judge's own from a previous round.

TRUNCATION IS DECLARED, NEVER SILENT. A diff clipped without saying so is a judge
reasoning about a file it thinks it read to the end.
