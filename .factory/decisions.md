# Open decisions

<!--
  THE POINT OF THIS FILE IS THAT A DECISION IS ASKED ONCE.

  Without it, one unmade product decision is re-discovered by every issue that
  touches it and reported as a fresh escalation each time. The human sees four
  interruptions and concludes the factory refuses too much work -- when it actually
  refused one thing, four times.

  READ ORDER, for every node about to stop:
    1. Is the decision already ANSWERED below? Then it is not open. Use it, cite the ID.
    2. Is it OPEN below? Then do not re-ask it. Reference the ID and plan around it.
    3. Neither? Only then is it new -- and even then, most product values are decided
       and recorded in ASSUMPTIONS rather than escalated. See FACTORY_RULES §7.

  A human answers by moving an entry to Answered and writing the value. That single
  edit unblocks everything listed against it.

## Open

<!-- One per decision. Blocks: list every issue waiting on it, so the cost is visible. -->

## Answered

<!-- Never delete one. A decision with its date is why the code looks the way it
     does, and it is the first thing anybody re-litigating it needs to read. -->
