"""_selftest.py -- the harness for the factory's own machinery.

`harness/` asks "is the product working?". THIS asks "is the thing that decides
that working?", and the two are not the same question. Every check below exists
because the behaviour it pins was once wrong in a way that read as normal
operation: a lock released a tick after it was taken, a gate that passed on an
empty log, a state machine that let a node walk an item back out of needs-human.

Fast, offline, no network, no GitHub. The doctor runs it on every audit, so a
regression here is reported before the dial is trusted rather than after.
