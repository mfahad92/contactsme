"""Proof that the watchdog can fire, and that it stays quiet when it should.

    python factory/_test_watchdog.py            the detector proofs
    python factory/_test_watchdog.py --replay   re-run the real 2026-09-01 incident

TWO OBLIGATIONS, and the second is the one that is usually skipped.

 1. EVERY DETECTOR MUST FIRE on a history that deserves it. A detector nobody has
    watched go red is a detector nobody should trust. On this project a check once went
    VACUOUS instead of red -- it derived its own test cases from the table it was
    auditing, so with the bug present it simply generated nothing and reported 118
    passes rather than 119 failures. Passing is not evidence.

 2. EVERY DETECTOR MUST STAY SILENT on a healthy history. A detector that always fires
    is not a safety net, it is an off switch with extra steps, and the first false halt
    teaches everyone to disable the watchdog. `healthy` below is deliberately BUSY --
    many dispatches, several targets, a couple of failures -- because a detector that
    only stays quiet on an idle factory has not been tested at all.
