"""THE CONFIGURATION SURFACE. This is the file you edit.

Everything project-specific in the factory reads from here. If you find yourself
editing another module to change a path, a command or a marker name, that is a bug
in this file and it should grow a setting instead. The point of concentrating it is
that six months from now you can see your whole factory's configuration on one
screen.

Every setting is overridable from the environment with the same name, so a single
run can be driven differently without editing anything:

    FACTORY_AUTONOMY=1 python factory/dispatch.py

Keep this file to assignments. No side effects, nothing that can fail, nothing that
prints -- it is imported by every other module and by workflow script nodes.

# A check that never ran produces no failures, and code that asks "did anything
# fail?" reads that as success -- so the gate never asks that question. It asks
# "did this specific thing report that it ran?"
#
# APP_STARTED and E2E_PASSED are not negotiable: they are the two gates that must
# be code in every factory. Add one marker per check family you build.
# WHICH MARKER MEANS WHAT, named in config rather than hardcoded in the checks.

# refused a dial it had fully earned -- the product hardcoding its own example, exactly
