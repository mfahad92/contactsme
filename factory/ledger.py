"""The factory's memory of what it just did.

    python factory/ledger.py tail 20        the last 20 events
    python factory/ledger.py stats 180      what happened in the last 180 minutes

WHY THIS EXISTS. Every dispatcher tick is stateless by design: read GitHub, pick one
thing, dispatch, exit. That is a good design -- it means a tick cannot be poisoned by
what a previous tick believed -- but it has one consequence nobody had priced in.

**A process with no memory of its own actions cannot notice that it is repeating
itself.** The per-target lock prevents two dispatches at the SAME TIME. Nothing
prevented the same dispatch happening 68 times IN SEQUENCE, which is exactly what
happened on 2026-09-01: one rejected pull request re-validated every tick for three
and a half hours, $17.18, while the rest of the queue was never reached.

Each tick was individually correct. The pathology existed only in the sequence, and
the sequence was the one thing nothing was written down in.

So: an append-only line per event. This file is the substrate the watchdog reads. It
is deliberately dumb -- no analysis here, no thresholds, no opinions. It records.

APPEND-ONLY, AND TOLERANT ON READ. A corrupt or half-written line (the machine died
mid-write) is skipped rather than fatal. A watchdog that crashes on its own input is
a watchdog that is off exactly when things are going wrong.
