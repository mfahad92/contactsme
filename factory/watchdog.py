"""Does this factory look like it is making progress, or like it is stuck in a loop?

    python factory/watchdog.py              assess, halt if a detector trips
    python factory/watchdog.py --report     assess and print, change nothing
    python factory/watchdog.py --explain    the detectors and their thresholds

RUN AT THE TOP OF EVERY TICK, immediately after the stop button, before the queue is
read. A watchdog that only runs when somebody remembers to run it is a postmortem.

WHY IT EXISTS. On 2026-09-01 the dispatcher re-validated one rejected pull request 68
times in three and a half hours ($17.18) and never reached the rest of the queue. Every
individual tick was correct. `escalate()` wrote `factory:needs-human`, the next tick read
the PR back as `open` because of a table bug, and it went straight to the front of the
queue again. The pathology lived entirely in the SEQUENCE, and nothing in the system
looked at sequences.

The specific table bug is fixed. This file exists because the NEXT bug of that shape
will not be that bug, and the failure mode it produced -- burn money, make no progress,
look busy -- is the one an unattended factory must never be able to sustain.

THE DESIGN CONSTRAINT THAT MATTERS: `assess()` IS A PURE FUNCTION of a list of events
and a clock. It reads nothing, writes nothing, and asks no service anything. That is
what makes every detector below provable: a test hands it a synthetic history and
asserts the detector fires. A watchdog nobody has watched fail is a watchdog nobody
should trust, and the first version of a check on this project went VACUOUS instead of
red, which is worse than having no check at all.

HALTING IS THE POINT. A finding at HALT severity writes `.factory/STOP` and notifies.
It does not warn and hope. Escalating without stopping is what produced the incident:
the label was written correctly every time and the machine drove straight through it.
