"""The dispatcher. Component 2, built last on purpose.

    python factory/dispatch.py              dispatch at most MAX_PARALLEL things, exit
    python factory/dispatch.py --dry-run    say what it would do, do nothing

It answers exactly one question -- "what, if anything, should run right now?" --
from a fixed priority order and the labels on GitHub. NO MODEL IS CONSULTED.

That is not a stylistic preference. A model asked "what work is pending?" will
invent dispatches for issues that were never filed and PRs that do not exist. It is
a plausible-sounding answer with nothing behind it, and the factory then acts on it.
The dumbest component in the system is the one where a wrong answer is worse than no
answer.

NOTHING PUSHES. Filing an issue does not trigger a run. There is no webhook and
there is not meant to be one: a scheduler wakes on a timer, reads the state, and
dispatches. An issue filed at 09:01 waits for the next tick. A push trigger that
breaks fails SILENTLY and looks exactly like a factory with nothing to do; a poll
that breaks is a poll you can see not running.

From cron, once the dial is above 0. Slower than feels right:
    */30 * * * * cd /path/to/repo && python factory/dispatch.py >> factory.log 2>&1

    THE WEDGE THIS REMOVES, and it is the most likely one on a real machine. The lock
    is released when the run settles. It is NOT released when the process is KILLED:
    a reboot, the machine sleeping, a power cut, someone closing the terminal, the
    OOM killer. The lock file then survives its owner, counts toward capacity
    forever, and every subsequent tick logs "at capacity, nothing dispatched" and
    exits 0 -- indistinguishable from a factory with nothing to do.

    THE PID ON THE LOCK IS NOT THE RUN'S PID, and this is the whole subtlety.
    Dispatch is detached: `archon workflow run` hands the work to a child and returns
    in seconds, so the recorded pid is dead almost immediately while the run has
    another twenty minutes to go. The first version of this reaped on "pid gone AND
    older than GRACE", and its docstring said a live lap is never touched because its
    pid is alive. That sentence was false for every dispatch this system makes: an
    implement lap ran nine minutes, its lock was reaped at five, and the reconcile
    sweep escalated it as dead while it went on to finish and open a pull request.

    So the pid test applies to exactly one case: a lock with NO run id, meaning the
    dispatch died before it could record one. There the pid IS the only owner there
    ever was.

    A lock that names a run is freed by evidence about THAT RUN -- release_settled_
    locks() asking the engine -- or by the long stale cap, which is the backstop for

    archon workflow get X" -- and that id appears nowhere in the engine's run record.
    Measured on four consecutive dispatches: the timestamps matched to the second,
    the workflow names matched, and the overlap between the ids the factory tracked

    detectors had no cost to add up. Each of those looked like its own bug and got its
    own patch; they were one bug wearing three hats.

    So the id is resolved by the one key the factory itself controls: `user_message`,
    which dispatch() sets to "<action> <target>" and the engine stores verbatim. The

    nothing, and the engine's run list does not report a branch -- so anything that
    infers liveness from a name is guessing.

    The first version of this guessed, and the guess collapsed to nothing: it built
    the set of active *branches*, every entry came back blank, the blanks were

    EMPTY IS NOT AN ANSWER. Every unknown below KEEPS the lock and leaves it to the
