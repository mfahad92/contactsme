"""The deterministic audit. `factory doctor` runs this.

    python factory/doctor.py            report
    python factory/doctor.py --level 3  can this repo run at level 3?

A CHECKLIST, not a test suite. It is meant to fail loudly on a fresh install --
that is it working, and working through it is the build.

The one property that makes it worth having: IT BLOCKS THE DIAL. Level 2 needs a
real E2E; level 3 needs a holdout, a mutation set and a ratchet. So "build for
level 3" cannot quietly become "switch on level 3" before the evidence exists.
