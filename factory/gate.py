"""The structural gate. One of the two decisions made by code a model cannot argue past.

    python factory/gate.py <pr-target> <gate-log> <verdict.json>

It reads the RAW output of the validation run and the verdict the judge wrote, and
it lets a merge happen only when both agree. WHEN THEY DISAGREE, THE RAW OUTPUT
WINS and the PR escalates -- because a model summarising its own run is precisely
what cannot be trusted at this step.

Every check below is a POSITIVE assertion. None of them test for the absence of the
word "error". A check that never ran produces no failures, and "did anything fail?"
reads that as success.

Exit codes:
    0  GATE_PASS (merge performed) or GATE_PASS_HELD (green, merge held for a human)
    1  GATE_FAIL -- escalated to needs-human
    2  GATE_REFUSED -- called from the wrong state; nothing to gate on
    3  CHANGES_REQUESTED / REJECTED -- a verdict was recorded, no merge
