"""Fail loudly if a builder artifact reached the validator. FACTORY_RULES 9.

    python factory/tripwire.py <validator-working-dir>

This should be impossible. The validator runs in its own worktree with its own
context and its own artifacts directory, so the plan and the implementation report
are simply not there.

It is checked anyway, because the failure it guards against is SILENT BY
CONSTRUCTION. If separation ever breaks -- a shared worktree, a stray copy, a broad
`git add` that swept up `.claude/plans/`, a future change that reuses a directory --
the validator keeps producing confident verdicts and every one of them is
contaminated. Nothing goes red. The verdicts just quietly start agreeing with the
builder.

An independence property that nobody checks is an independence property nobody has.

=============================================================================
WHAT COUNTS AS AN ARTIFACT, and why the obvious answer is wrong
=============================================================================

The first version of this matched on filename alone -- `**/plan.md`,
`**/investigation.md` -- and it fired on the very first real validation, against
`.archon/workflows/factory/implement/commands/plan.md`.

That file is the workflow's own PROMPT. It is checked into the repository, it is
byte-identical in every worktree including main, and it says nothing whatsoever about
how this particular branch was written. Blocking on it does not protect the holdout;
it stops the factory.

The distinction that actually matters is not the NAME, it is the PROVENANCE:

    tracked in git      part of the repository. Every checkout has it. Not evidence.
    untracked, matching a builder path   produced by a RUN. That is the leak.

So this flags a file only when it is BOTH shaped like a builder artifact AND not
tracked. A false positive here is not harmless -- it wedges every validation, which
looks exactly like a factory with nothing to do.
