    python factory/guard.py [--base <ref>] [--head <ref>]

FACTORY_RULES 5, 6 and 8. This runs BEFORE any other evaluation, because a change
that can edit the rulebook must not be judged against the edited rulebook.

Exits:
    0  PROTECTED_OK
    1  PROTECTED_VIOLATION / SCOPE_VIOLATION / SIZE_VIOLATION -- auto-reject
    2  GUARD_ERROR -- the guard could not run, which is NOT a pass

Exit code 2 matters more than it looks. A guard that cannot determine the diff must
FAIL CLOSED. Failing open here means "we could not check, so we merged", which is
the same class of mistake as counting a skipped check as a passed one.
