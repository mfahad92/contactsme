"""The state machine. GitHub issues and PRs, `factory:*` labels as the state.

    python factory/state.py next                     what the dispatcher should run
    python factory/state.py get gh:issue:3
    python factory/state.py set gh:issue:3 state=accepted priority=high
    python factory/state.py body gh:issue:3          the item, as text a node can read
    python factory/state.py comment gh:pr:4          body on stdin
    python factory/state.py list issues --state accepted
    python factory/state.py bump-attempt gh:pr:4
    python factory/state.py stop-requested
    python factory/state.py init-labels

WHY THE LABELS ARE THE STATE. They are visible, editable by a human from a phone,
already backed up, and they ARE the audit trail. No database, no message bus. If
information has to travel between workflows it moves as a label or a comment.

`set` REFUSES a transition the table does not allow. That refusal is the reason
this is a module rather than three lines of `gh` in a workflow: a node that wants a
transition the table forbids has misunderstood something, and inventing the
transition buries the misunderstanding instead of surfacing it.

FOUR THINGS LABELS ARE NOT, all learned the hard way and all handled below:

 1. There is no compare-and-swap. Two dispatchers reading `factory:accepted` both
    claim the issue. The label is the audit trail, not the mutex -- the per-target
    lock in dispatch.py is.
 2. Label writes are not immediately visible to label reads. Measured lag between
    setting a label and seeing it on the list endpoint was two to four seconds, so
    nothing here writes and immediately re-reads to confirm its own write.
 3. The stop button must be a label you ADD, and the read must FAIL CLOSED.
 4. Closed is not a disposition. `deferred` and `rejected` are both closed issues
    and indistinguishable without labels -- and GitHub performs transitions this
    table never authorised (a merged PR saying `Closes #N` closes the issue), so
    closed-and-unlabelled is a real state that has to be handled.

# TRANSITIONS has always listed needs-human as a legal PR destination, so the two
