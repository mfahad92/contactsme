"""Component 2, the trigger. Built LAST on purpose.

    python factory/trigger.py --status
    python factory/trigger.py --install
    python factory/trigger.py --remove

TURNING ON A SCHEDULER IS THE MOMENT THE REPO BECOMES AUTONOMOUS. Everything before
it can be run by hand and inspected. A factory whose dispatcher was built first is an
unsupervised code generator that nobody has ever checked.

IT REFUSES BELOW DIAL 1. A scheduler at level 0 wakes up forever and correctly does
nothing, which is exactly how people convince themselves a factory is running when it
has never completed a lap.

NOTHING PUSHES. There is no webhook and there is not meant to be one: this wakes on a
timer, reads the state, and dispatches at most MAX_PARALLEL things. An issue filed at
09:01 waits for the next tick. A push trigger that breaks fails SILENTLY and looks
exactly like a factory with nothing to do; a poll that breaks is a poll you can see
not running.
